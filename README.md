# Resource packs
Allows you to create your own custom interface styles by not being only restricted to 2005/2006/2010 ones.

## How to use it:
1. Add it from the plugin-hub
2. Download a resource pack from down below or somewhere else
3. Set the path to where your resource pack is stored in (without the trailing /)
4. Make sure your interface styles plugin is set to the DEFAULT skin (it can cause weird issues otherwise)
5. Restart the plugin and your resource pack should load in

## How to create a resource pack
1. Download one of the sample packs or resource packs
2. Edit the images while keeping the image sizes and folder structure the same
3. If you want your resource pack to be published on here, message me in Runelite discord
